        | Use RandomForest for ETA **(Estimated Time of Arrival)** System, RandomForest provides more accurate predictions with smaller errors and explains 80% of the variation in delivery duration.                       |
        | Use XGBoost for **Slow Delivery Detection**, XGBoost minimizes the risk of missing delayed packages due to its higher recall.                                                                                      |
        | Evaluate Model Performance Periodically, Perform monthly evaluations of both models (using **MAE, R¬≤, and recall**) to ensure consistent performance.                                                              |
        | Integrate Results into **Real-Time Dashboard**, Integrate the results into a real-time operation dashboard, allowing the team to take proactive actions such as customer notifications or rescheduling deliveries. |
