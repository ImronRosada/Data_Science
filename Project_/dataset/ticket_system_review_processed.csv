We evaluated 3 top-tier customer support management system products to manage our complex array of products and Freshdesk was the clear winner on functionality and price. While it's true, one of the contenders could have met our needs a tiny bit better. The price tag was 8x higher than Freshdesk.That's not a joke. From the moment I saw Freshdesk, I loved the simplistic design of the site. It reflects how they do all of their development. Features are added gracefully and in ways I don't always expect. For example, we had major problems with multiple agents working on the same ticket.Freshdesk added a very simple indicator that shows icons detailing that someone else is looking at that same ticket. It's very subtle, but very effective. All of their features are focused on high-usability, without cluttering the screen with additional controls. It reminds me of how Apple does UI.

Workspace from Facebook calls my attention eventhou is also cloud base but is the closes in Features. Just like the Standalone version of Zendesk that we all learn too user the codes and independency of running the software on the local network overpasses any cloud base solution in my opinion. Automations and Macros are great working locally without the need of High bandwith which we can afford in USA but on other locations in the caribean is a luxury even for big business to have the bandwith we have. OOOOhh And what happens at hurricane season? when we had blackouts we still ran the Zendesk locally. An example of such dependency of cloud based systems is the Automations function doesn't flow in a similar way but are timed instead of instantaneous compare to local run version of the software. Macros allow you to update a ticket's tags, message, and other information with a click of a button.
